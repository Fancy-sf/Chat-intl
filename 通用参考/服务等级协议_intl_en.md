**The Service Availability of the Service provided by Tencent Cloud will be** **no less than** **99%**. You are entitled to the compensation as set forth in Section 3 below if the Service Availability fails to meet the aforementioned standard, other than in any circumstance as provided for in the release of liabilities provisions below.

(1) Compensations will be made **in the form of voucher** by Tencent Cloud, and you should follow the rules for using the voucher (including the valid term; for details, please refer to the rules of vouchers published on Tencent Cloud’s official website). You cannot redeem such voucher for cash or request to issue an invoice for such voucher. Such voucher can only be used to purchase the Service by using your Tencent Cloud account. You cannot use the voucher to purchase other services of Tencent Cloud, nor should you give the voucher to a third party for consideration or for free.

(2) If the Service Availability for a Service Month fails to meet the standard, the amount of compensation will be calculated for such month independently, and **the aggregate amount shall be no more than the applicable Monthly Service Fee paid by you for such month** (the Monthly Service Fee referred to herein shall exclude the fee deducted by a voucher or promotional coupon, Service fee discounted or waived, or fees otherwise deductible). 

| **Service   Availability** **(Av)** **for a Service Month** | **Value   of Compensation Voucher** |

| 90% > Av                                                    | 30% of the Monthly Service Fee      |
