>| 4005       | File message failed: Illegal or blocked files cannot be sent. |
>| 6015       | Operation in progress. Optimize the control over API calls. For example, if another initialization operation is performed before the first initialization operation is called back, the system returns this error code. |
>| 6017       | Invalid parameter. Check the error information to locate the invalid parameter. |
>| 6022       | Local I/O operation error. Check whether you have the read/write permission or whether the disk is full. |
>| 6027       | Incorrect JSON format. Check the error information to locate the specific field. |
>| 6028       | Insufficient memory. A memory leak may occur. Analyze and identify the location with high memory usage by using the Instrument tool on the iOS platform or the Profiler tool on the Android platform. |

>| 6005       | Failed to load the local database, possibly due to file corruption. |
>| 6019       | Operation on the local database failed. This error may be caused by a lack of permissions for some directories or file corruption in the database. |
>| 7001       | Cross-thread error. Cross-thread operations are not supported. Internal error. |

>| 7013       | The current package does not support this API. Please upgrade to the Flagship Edition package. |
>| 7014       | Invalid request. Check the API call meets requirements.      |

>| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
>| 9501       | SSO encryption failed. Internal error.                       |
>| 9502       | SSO decryption failed. Internal error.                       |

>| 9504       | Failed to compress the data packet. Internal error.          |
>| 9505       | Failed to decompress the data packet. Internal error.        |
>| 9506       | The call frequency exceeds the frequency limit. You can initiate up to 5 requests per second. |
>| 9507       | The network request queue exceeds the maximum number (1,000) of concurrent requests allowed. For example, when users keep sending messages when the network is abnormal, the network request queue will keep adding new requests without consumption and quickly reach the maximum number of requests. |
>| 9508       | The network is disconnected, no connection has been set up, or no network is detected when setting up a socket connection. |
>| 9509       | A network connection has been established, but is created repeatedly. Internal error. |
>| 9510       | Network connection setup timed out. Try again after the network recovers. |
>| 9511       | The network connection setup has been rejected by the server due to frequent connection requests. |
>| 9512       | No available route to the network. Try again after the network recovers. |
>| 9513       | Insufficient buffer capacity for calls. The system is too busy. Internal error. |
>| 9514       | The peer end has reset the connection, possibly because the server is overloaded. The SDK automatically initiates reconnection. Try again after the network is reconnected and the callback function `onConnSucc` on iOS or `onConnected` on Android is called successfully. |
>| 9515       | Invalid socket. Internal error.                              |
>| 9516       | Failed to parse the IP address. Internal error. The local `imsdk_config` file may be corrupted and can cause the system to read an invalid IP address. |
>| 9517       | Invalid connection. The network is connected to an intermediate node or is reset by the server. This is an internal error. The SDK automatically initiates reconnection. Try again after the network is reconnected and the callback function `onConnSucc` on iOS or `onConnected` on Android is called successfully. |
>| 9518       | The request packet timed out when waiting to enter the sending queue. This usually occurs when the network connection setup is slow or the network is frequently disconnected and reconnected. Check whether the network connection is normal. |
>| 9519       | The request packet entered the Chat SDK sending queue but timed out while waiting to enter the network layer of the operating system. This usually occurs when the local network is restricted or disconnected or the local network and the Chat SDK backend are not connected. We recommend that you run the Chat SDK in different network environments to check whether this issue is caused by the current network environment. |
>| 9520       | The request packet entered the network layer of the operating system from the Chat SDK sending queue but timed out while waiting for a response packet from the server. This usually occurs when the local network is restricted or disconnected or the local network and the Chat SDK backend are not connected. We recommend that you run the Chat SDK in different network environments to check whether this issue is caused by the current network environment. |
>| 9521       | The request packet has entered the sending queue, certain data has been sent, but the remaining data timed out when waiting to be sent. This usually occurs because the upstream bandwidth is insufficient or the network is connected when the error is called back. Please check whether the network connection is normal. |
>| 9522       | The request packet length exceeds the maximum limit of 1 MB. |
>| 9523       | The request packet has entered the sending queue but timed out when waiting to enter the network buffer of the system. This usually occurs because too many packets are to be sent, the sending thread is too busy to handle the packets, or the network is disconnected when the error code is called back. |
>| 9524       | The request packet has entered the network buffer of the system but timed out when waiting for the server to return packets. This usually occurs because the request packet does not leave the client device, is discarded in an intermediate route, or is dropped accidentally by the server, the response packet is discarded by the network layer of the system, or the network is disconnected when the error code is called back. |
>| 9525       | The request packet has entered the sending queue, certain data has been sent, but the remaining data timed out when waiting to be sent. This usually occurs because the upstream bandwidth is insufficient or the network is disconnected when the error code is called back. Please check whether the network connection is normal. |

>| -302       | The number of server connections exceeds the limit. The server refused to provide services. |
>| -10001     | Key expired. A key is an internal credential generated based on the UserSig. The validity period of a key is less than or equal to that of the UserSig. Call the `TIMManager.getInstance().login` API again to generate a new key. |
>| -10003     | Ticket expired. A ticket is an internal credential generated based on the UserSig. The validity period of a ticket is less than or equal to that of the UserSig. Call the `TIMManager.getInstance().login` API again to generate a new ticket. |
>| -10004     | Ticket verification failed. Call the `TIMManager.getInstance().login` API again to generate a new ticket. |
>| -10005     | The key cannot be empty.                                     |

>| -10111     | The SDKAppID is on the service CMD blocklist.                |
>| -10112     | The SDKAppID has been disabled.                              |
>| -10113     | The request exceeds the frequency limit allowed for the user. The frequency limit is set for the number of requests per second based on a specific protocol. |
>| -10114     | Packet loss due to system overload. The connected server has too many requests to process and therefore refuses to provide services. |
>| -20009     | The frequency of terminals accessing APIs exceeds the limit. |
