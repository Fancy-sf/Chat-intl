## Billing Overview
IM is billed on a monthly billing cycle:
- Fees are billed by calendar month. Fees incurred in a calendar month will be deducted within the first 3 days of the next month.


## Basic Services
The basic service fee covers two parts: the **resource plan** fee and **resource usage exceeding the quota in a plan** fee.
- Resource plan: IM offers the Free, Pro, and Ultimate editions. The edition for a created application defaults to the Free edition (free). You can choose a plan based on your needs. For resource plan comparison, see [Comparison of billing plans](#tc).
- Fees for out-of-plan resource usage: The fees charged for DAU count and peak group count that exceed the free quota of the Pro or Ultimate edition plan.

- **Maximum audio-video groups that can be created**: The total number of audio-video groups that can be created by all users under an application (SDKAppID). Audio-video groups support only text, image, short audio, and custom messages. Services such as [Cloud Streaming Services](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267) and [Tencent Real-Time Communication](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647) need to be activated separately.
- **Maximum net increase in group quantity per day**: The net total number of groups (of all types) that can be created by all users under an application (SDKAppID) in a calendar day. Its value is 10,000, and up to 5 online broadcasting chat rooms can be created. If the quantity of groups created reaches the threshold of the day, but you need to create more groups, delete the groups that are no longer needed. For more information, see [Groups](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33529).
- **DAU**: The number of unique users that log in to IM on a given day. A user that logs in repeatedly on the same day only counts as one DAU.

- **Community**: A community allows users to join and leave freely. It is suitable for chat scenarios with a super large number of community members, such as knowledge sharing and game discussion. For more information, see [Groups](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33529).

<dx-alert infotype="explain" title="Notes:">

- A value-added service applies to the application (SDKAppID) bound only. To upgrade the services for multiple applications (SDKAppID), handle them one by one.
- Increasing the maximum members per group:
   - Different group types have different member limits. For more information, see [Group Features](https://www.tencentcloud.com/zh/document/product/1047/33515#.E7.BE.A4.E7.BB.84.E5.8A.9F.E8.83.BD).
   - After you purchase the [Increasing the max members per group](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/34577) service or upgrade your plan, call [RESTful API](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34962) to update the group member limits before adjusting the member limits of existing non-audio-video groups.
- Extending the retention period of historical messages: The service supports extending the retention period of text, image, short audio, short video, file and custom messages, but specific message types supported vary by SDK version. For more information, see [Message Storage](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33524). Since this service requires additional resources, fees will be charged by month from the month the service is activated. We recommend you activate the service at a proper time.
- **Audio/video call feature**:
  - **The Audio/video call feature is currently in beta, with a 60-day free edition provided**.
  - It is implemented based on IM and TRTC services. Therefore, the TRTC service will be activated and applications created for you by default if you enable this feature.
  - Its free edition **only grants you the right to use the free edition free of charge. Your calls launched via this feature will be charged as stated in [Billing of TRTC Basic Services](https://www.tencentcloud.com/zh/document/product/647/42734), and relevant IM services will be charged as stated in [Billing Overview](https://www.tencentcloud.com/zh/document/product/1047/34349) of IM**.
