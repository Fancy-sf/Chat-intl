## Chat Service Pricing
The Chat service pricing consists of two parts: [basic service fee](#jc) and [value-added service fee](#zz).

### Basic service fee[](id:jc)
The basic service fee covers two parts: the **resource plan** fee and **out-of-plan resource usage** fee.
- Resource plan fee: Chat offers the Developer, Standard, and Premium editions. The edition for a created application defaults to the Developer edition (free). You can choose a plan based on your needs. For resource plan comparison, see [Comparison of billing plans](#tc).
- Out-of-plan resource usage fee: The fee charged for resource usage that exceeds the free quota of the Standard or Premium edition plan.


The billing details are as follows:

>- MAU calculates the number of unique users that log in to your Chat app in a given month. After a user logs in successfully by calling the `login` function of the Chat SDK to establish a persistent connection with the Chat backend, MAU will be increased by one. A user that logs in repeatedly in the same month is considered as one user only for MAU. Use the `login` function appropriately according to business scenarios to avoid an excessively high MAU.
