4. ## Use Cases
   This document describes how to create Free edition apps and obtain SDKAppIDs. It also covers how to upgrade Free edition apps to Pro edition apps using the IM console.

   ## Prerequisites
   You have [signed up](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/17985) for a Tencent Cloud account and completed [identity verification](http://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/3629).

   ## Creating a Free App
   1. Log in to the [IM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/im).
   2. Click **Create Application**.
   3. In the **Create Application** dialog box, enter your app name, and click **Confirm**.
       After the app is created, you can view the status, service version, SDKAppID, creation time, and expiration time of the new app on the overview page of the console.

   <dx-alert infotype="explain" title="">
   By default, a new app is a trial app and enabled.
   A Tencent Cloud account can create a maximum of 300 IM apps. If you want to create more apps, [disable and delete](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34540) an unwanted app first and then create a new one. **Once an app (along with its SDKAppID) is deleted, the service it provides and all its data are lost. Please proceed with caution**.

   ## Upgrading an App
   >?You can use a plan to upgrade an app from the Free edition to the Pro edition or Ultimate edition but cannot roll it back to the Free edition after the upgrade. After the services of an app are suspended due to overdue payments or refunds, if you need to continue to use the services, you can renew the Pro edition or Ultimate edition plan. If you want to go back to the Free edition, [create a new app](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34577).


   1. Click **View Upgradeable Items** in the target app card to view the comparison of upgradeable items.
