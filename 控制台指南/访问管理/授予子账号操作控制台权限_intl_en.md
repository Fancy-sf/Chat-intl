## Overview
This document describes two authorization methods to resolve the following issues. Detailed steps are as below. To configure more complex permission policies, see [Custom Policy](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/38088).
- When you are using the IM service with a sub-account, the root account needs to authorize the sub-account to access the [IM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/im) and to configure settings. Otherwise, the console will not display the application list, as shown below:

- When a sub-account has access to tags, but it does not match its access to the console application tags, the sub-account cannot view the newly created applications.


## Solution 1. Global Authorization
### Step 1. Go to CAM to authorize
Log in to the [CAM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam) using the root account, go to **User List**, click **Authorize** on the left of the sub-user, and the **Associate Policy** dialog box will pop up.

>- **Read/write access**: Allows users to access the console and modify configurations.
>- **Read-only access**: Allows users to access the console only, not to perform other operations.
### Step 3. Complete authorization
If **Policy associated** is prompted in the upper right corner, the authorization is completed.

## Solution 2. Authorization by Tag
This solution is designed for customers who need to authorize and manage sub-accounts by tag. Sub-accounts can only access and operate applications under the authorized tags.
>!
>- After a tag policy is assigned to a sub-account, the sub-account cannot access or operate applications with no tags. For a sub-account, there are no tags in a newly created application in the [IM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/im). Therefore, the root account needs to change the application tags to authorized tags so that the sub-account can use the application.
>- If you want to grant a sub-account the access to an existing app by tag, make sure you have configured tags for the app; otherwise, you will be unable to authorize by tag.
>- If no tags are configured for the app, go to the [Basic Configuration](https://console.intl.cloud.tencent.com/im/detail) page in the IM console to configure. For more information, see the **Configuring Tags** section in [Basic Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34540). 
>- You can also go to [Tag List](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tag/taglist) to bind multiple apps to a tag at a time. For more information, see the **Binding resources** section in [Creating Tags and Binding Resources](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/651/41575).

### Step 1. Go to CAM to authorize
Log in to the [CAM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam) using the root account, click **Policies** > **Create Custom Policy**, and the **Select Policy Creation Method** dialog box will pop up.
