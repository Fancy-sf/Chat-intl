
## Feature Overview

The Content Filtering feature uses natural language processing (NLP) technologies to determine whether user profiles, group profiles, one-to-one text messages, and group text messages in the IM system comply with regulations. This ensures automatic identification of unsafe or inappropriate content, reduces operational costs significantly, and enhances the product experience.

## Custom Message Filtering
To provide custom message filtering, IM needs to use a third-party content filtering service.

The following figure shows the detailed process of custom message filtering. First, the IM SDK sends a message to the IM backend. The IM backend makes a request to the business backend for a callback before sending the [one-to-one message](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34364) or [group message](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34374). Second, the business backend copies the message content to the third-party content filtering service. After the third-party content filtering service returns the content filtering result, the business backend forwards the result to the IM backend. Last, the IM backend determines whether to deliver the message.

## Image, Short Video, and Voice Filtering
To provide image, short video, and voice filtering, IM needs to use a third-party content filtering service.

The following figure shows the detailed process for image, short video, and voice filtering. First, the IM SDK sends a message to the IM backend. The IM backend delivers the message and makes a request to the business backend for a callback after sending the [one-to-one message](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34365) or [group message](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34375). Second, the business backend copies the message content to the third-party content filtering service. After the third-party content filtering service returns the content filtering result, the business backend forwards the result to the IM backend.
