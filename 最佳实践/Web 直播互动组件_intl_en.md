## Overview
### TUIPusher
- Capturing and publishing streams from camera and mic
  - Customizing video parameters including frame rate, resolution, and bitrate
  - Applying beauty filters and setting beauty filter parameters
- Capturing and publishing data from the screen

- Text chatting with the anchor and other audience members
- Getting the audience list and muting audience members

### TUIPlayer
- Playing the audio/video stream and screen sharing stream at the same time
- Text chatting with the anchor and other audience members
- Three playback options: ultra-low-latency live streaming (300 ms latency), high-speed live streaming (latency within 1,000 ms), and standard live streaming (ultra-high concurrency)
- Supports desktop and mobile browsers and landscape mode on mobile devices
> !
> If your browser does not support WebRTC and can play videos only using standard live streaming protocols, please use a different browser to try WebRTC playback.

## Integration
### Notes
- `TUIPusher` and `TUIPlayer` are based on TRTC and IM. Make sure you use the same `SDKAppID` for your TRTC and IM applications so that they can share your account and authentication information.
- You can use the basic-edition content filtering capability of IM to filter chat messages. If you want to customize restricted words, go to the IM console > **Content Filtering**, and click **Upgrade**.
- Local `UserSig` calculation is for development and local debugging only and not for official launch. The correct `UserSig` distribution method is to integrate the calculation code of `UserSig` into your server and provide an application-oriented API. When `UserSig` is needed, your application can send a request to the business server for a dynamic `UserSig`. For more information, see [Generating UserSig](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34385).

### Step 1. Create an application
<dx-tabs>
::: Method 1: via \sIM
#### Step 1. Create an IM app
1. Log in to the [IM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/im), and click **Create Application**.
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/7382cbcd81df7afbad1e9af641697c87.png)
2. In the pop-up window, enter an application name and click **Confirm**.
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/b3a630da00564cf7ef4a91b8492b646e.png)
3. Go to the [overview page](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/im) to view the status, edition, `SDKAppID`, creation time, and expiration time of the application created. Note the `SDKAppID`.

#### Step 2. Obtain the key and activate TRTC
1. On the [overview page](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/im), click the application created to go to the **Basic Configuration** page. In the **Basic Information** section, click **Display key**, and copy and save the key.
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/6f284cf687e9648d209567ed32983c84.png)
>! Please store the key information properly to prevent disclosure.
2. On the **Basic Configuration** page, activate TRTC.

:::
::: Method 2: via TRTC
[](id:step1)
#### Step 1. Create a TRTC application
1. [Sign up for a Tencent Cloud account](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/register?s_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcloud.tencent.com%2Fdocument%2Fproduct%2F647%2F49327) and activate [TRTC](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/trtc) and [IM](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/im).
2. In the [TRTC console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/trtc), click **Application Management > Create Application** to create an application.
![Create application](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/9a50fca02d951862a3d0d38251835f76.png)

#### Step 2. Get the TRTC key information
1. In the application list, find the application created and click **Application Info** to view the `SDKAppID`.
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/6c39a936934a944cd1b13e2ced0869d2.png)
2. Select the **Quick Start** tab to view the application’s secret key.

<dx-alert infotype="explain">
- Accounts creating their first application in the TRTC console will get a 10,000-minute free trial package.
- After you create a TRTC application, an IM application with the same `SDKAppID` will be created automatically. You can configure package information for the application in the [IM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/im).</dx-alert>

### Step 2. Prepare your project

1. Download the code for `TUIPusher` and `TUIPlayer` at [GitHub](https://github.com/tencentyun/TUILiveRoom/tree/main/Web).
2. Install dependencies for `TUIPusher` and `TUIPlayer`.
```bash
cd Web/TUIPusher
npm install

cd Web/TUIPlayer
npm install
```
3. Paste `SDKAppID` and the secret key to the specified locations below in the `TUIPusher/src/config/basic-info-config.js` and `TUIPlayer/src/config/basic-info-config.js` files.
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/87dc814a675692e76145d76aab91b414.png)
4. Run `TUIPusher` and `TUIPlayer` in a local development environment.
```bash
cd Web/TUIPusher
npm run serve

cd Web/TUIPlayer
npm run serve
```
5. You can open `http://localhost:8080` and `http://localhost:8081` to try out the features of `TUIPusher` and `TUIPlayer`.
6. You can modify the room, anchor, and audience information in `TUIPusher/src/config/basic-info-config.js` and `TUIPlayer/src/config/basic-info-config.js`, but **make sure the room and anchor information is consistent in the two files**.

>!
>- You can now use `TUIPusher` and `TUIPlayer` for ultra-low-latency live streaming. If you want to support high-speed and standard live streaming too, see [Step 3. Enable relayed push](#step3).
>- Local calculation of `UserSig` is for development and local debugging only and not for official launch. If your `SECRETKEY` is leaked, attackers will be able to steal your Tencent Cloud traffic.
>- The correct `UserSig` distribution method is to integrate the calculation code of `UserSig` into your server and provide an application-oriented API. When `UserSig` is needed, your application can send a request to the business server for a dynamic `UserSig`. For more information, see [How do I calculate UserSig on the server?](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34385).

[](id:step3)
### Step 3. Enable relayed push

Because the high-speed and standard live streaming features of `TUIPusher` and `TUIPlayer` are powered by [CSS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267), you need to enable relayed push to use these features.

1. In the [TRTC console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/trtc), enable relayed push for your application. You can choose **Specified stream for relayed push** or **Global auto-relayed push** based on your needs. 
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/b65584a5b096481ade6e302dabedcd5f.png)
2. On the **[Domain Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/domainmanage)** page, add your playback domain name. For detailed directions, please see [Adding Your Own Domain Names](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/35970).
3. Configure the playback domain name in `TUIPlayer/src/config/basic-info-config.js`.

You can now use all features of `TUIPusher` and `TUIPlayer`, including ultra-low-latency live streaming, high-speed live streaming, and standard live streaming.

[](id:step4)
### Step 4. Apply in a production environment

To apply `TUIPusher` and `TUIPlayer` to a production environment, in addition to integrating them into your project, you also need to do the following:

- Create a user management system to manage user information such as user IDs, usernames, and profile pictures
- Create a room management system to manage room information such as room IDs, room names, and anchors
- Generate `UserSig` on your server
> !
>- In this document, `UserSig` is generated on the client based on the `SDKAppID` and secret key you provide. The secret key may be easily decompiled and reversed, and if your key is leaked, attackers will be able to steal your traffic. Therefore, **this method is for local debugging only**.
>- The correct `UserSig` distribution method is to integrate the calculation code of `UserSig` into your server and provide an application-oriented API. When `UserSig` is needed, your application can send a request to the business server for a dynamic `UserSig`. For more information, see [How do I calculate UserSig on the server?](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35166).
- Submit account information such as user information, room information, `SDKAppID`, and `UserSig` to `store` of `vuex` for global storage, as in `TUIPusher/src/pusher.vue` and `TUIPlayer/src/player.vue`, and you will be able to use all features of the two components on publishing and playback clients. The diagram below shows the process in detail:
